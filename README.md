## Experience


During the devlopment of Briefcase, I gained valuable exprience across multiple areas:

- Full-Stack Development: I learned how to develop both frontend and backend components of a web application to create a seamless user experience.
- React.js: I utilized and refined my skills in React.js, taking advantage of its component-based architecture to build dynamic interfaces.
- TypeScript: I learned Typescript for this project, taking my preexisting skills in Node.js to another level.
- TailwindCSS: I stylized each web component and page with TailwindCSS, learnign the principles of CSS and how to create a clean interface.
- MongoDB and Mongoose: I heavily utilized Mongoose in this project to store all user-related data.
- Deployment: I gained experience in deploying web applications, deploying both the frontend and backend to the cloud platform Vercel.
- UI/UX Design: I focused on creating an intuitive and minimalistic interface for Briefcase, and improved a lot on it during the course of its development.
- Project Management: I streamlined my development by making use of a Kanban board to improve efficiency and issue handling.

By working on Briefcase, I not only created a valuable application but also enhanced my technical skills and gained valuable insights into the proccess of developing a real-word web application by hand.
